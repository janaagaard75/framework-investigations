# TypeScript Marionette Todo App

Todo app written in TypeScript and using Marionette. Created to learn about combining these two technologies and the latest build tools. Heavily inspired by TodoMVC, but diverging from that project, especially by using Bootstrap instead of the default markup and CSS.
